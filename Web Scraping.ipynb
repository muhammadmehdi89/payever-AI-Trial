What differs is that the customer is forwarded to his online banking platform immediately after the purchase is made, where he logs in with his personal access data and confirms the transfer directly in his own bank. Once confirmed, you as the merchant immediately receive a confirmation from the bank that the full amount has been transferred, hence you do not need to wait for the transfer to be fully processed to be able to ship the order, which leads to quicker order processing and happier customers. The way it works is comparable to Klarna or paydirekt.

Theoretically, it is possible to take usable pictures, but it required a steady hand and is relatively cumbersome. ', 'Therefore, we recommend the usage of a USB document camera for laptops as well as for stationary computers (compact devices with an adjustable camera arm are particularly suitable). The use of such a camera has the advantage that, in addition to ID cards, any further documents that may be necessary, such as proof of earnings, can also easily be captured, so that this part of the application process can also be completed directly by scanning the documents with the camera (you no longer need a scanner and you also face fewer issues in terms of data protection law, since the documents are sent directly from the camera to our tool without saving the pictures anywhere on your device).', \"If you as a merchant do not have a camera on your device and you don't want to buy a camera, you can read the ID cards using a scanner if necessary.

Before taking pictures or scans: Which ID documents can actually be used?', 'Before you upload or scan any document, you have to choose between \"ID card\" and \"Passport\".

Therefore,', 'Please keep in mind, that machines are more sensitive to blurry text than humans - a slightly blurry image that is reasonable legible to the human eye can be too blurry for OCR to read. ', 'The blurrier the image, the higher is the likelihood that similar looking characters (e.g. 0 and O or 1 and 7) will be mixed up by the OCR.', '', '4. Angles:', 'If possible, please try to hold the camera in a straight line parallel to the ID card. The tolerance of the OCR for angled pictures (regardless of whether they are horizontal or vertical) is only 10° - accordingly documents with a clearly recongizable slant can usually not or only partially be read.', 'This also works better if you support yourself or place the device, if available, on a suitable holder.', '5. Edges:', 'Try to take the picture as close as possible so that the ID card takes up the majority of the picture (approx. 70%-80%), but stay far enough from the ID so that nothing is cut off and four edges and corners of the ID card are still included in the picture.', '', '6.
